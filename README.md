Description:  
A script that starts with a completely blank UCS system and configures it to completion. 

In this version of the script, you simply need to check to make sure that the variables for the UCSM IP address
and the credentials are correct, and the script will build your UCS system in exactly the manner described in the 
rest of the script. It is not meant to read out of a CSV file or modularize functions (yet), so change code at your discretion.

That being said, future iterations of the script will definitely utilize dynamic configuration methods so this is not necessary.
Needless to say, this version is pre-pre-Alpha. I published this because I wrote it specifically for one environment, and it met their needs.
